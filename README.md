This Snorkel Flow workshop demonstrates how to classify user intent from customer conversations using a real-world customer service scenario. The dataset includes 13,000 unlabeled data points and 300 labeled examples across 77 distinct intent classes.    

The workshop guides users through the process of improving a foundation model's intent classification accuracy. It uses Snorkel Flow to label data programmatically, train a machine learning model, and analyze errors to refine the model iteratively.  The key steps include:   

Leveraging a foundation model for initial intent classification.    

Developing Regex Labeling Functions (LFs) to capture specific intents.    

Training a model using the labeled data.    

Employing error-guided analysis with a confusion matrix to identify areas for improvement.    

The demo highlights how Snorkel Flow can address the limitations of LLMs in capturing specific organizational knowledge, and provides a practical approach to building more effective chatbot intent classification systems.
